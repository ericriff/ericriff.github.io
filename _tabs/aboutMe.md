My name is Eric Riff, I'm an Electronics Engineer from Argentina 🇦🇷.  
I'm currently working as a Software Developer for an industry-leading consumer robotics company specialized on robotic vacuum cleaners which shall remain unnamed 🤖.  
I work daily with tools like `CMake`, `Ninja`, `Clang` and `sentry`. I'm also deeply involved on the creation and  maintenance of a wide variety of packages. Some of the package formats I'm familiar with are `deb`, `wheels`, `ipks` and `conan`.  
In the past I worked on the Industrial Automation Industry programming PLCs and HMI/SCADAs, mainly for grain storage and processing facilities.  
I mainly use Linux 🐧 but I also know my way around Windows 🪟.

My name is Eric Riff, I'm an Electronics Engineer from Argentina.  
I'm currently working as a Software Developer for an industry-leading consumer robotics company specialized on robotic vacuum cleaners which shall remain unnamed. 
I work daily with tools like CMake, Ninja, Clang and sentry. I'm also deeply involved on the creation and  maintenance of a wide variety of packages like `deb`, `wheels`, `ipks` and `conan` packages.  
In the past I worked on the Industrial Automation Industry programming PLCs and HMI/SCADAs, mainly for grain storage and processing facilities.
